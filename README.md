# Two-Wheels-Robot 

I build a 2-wheel-robot that comprises of 
   1. STM32F411RET6 NUCLEO BOARD as Microcontroller
   2. MPU6050 as IMU
   3. DC Motors (Motor drivers also)
   4. Motor Incremental Encoders
   5. Ultrasonic sensors

This repository will provide:
- Embedded software for:
    - MPU6050 (I2C)
    - MOTORS  (Timers)
    - MOTOR ENCODERS (ADC)
    - ULTRASONIC SENSORS (ADC)
- Control Functions
